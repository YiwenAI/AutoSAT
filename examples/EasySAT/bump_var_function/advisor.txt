You are a SAT solver researcher trying to write the {{ task }} to help SAT solver escape from local optimum.
Your goal is to write a {{ task }} for the SAT solver that will help it restart the search and escape from local optimum, after reading and understanding the <key code> of SAT solver below.

Your answer must follow the following json format:
{
    "description":"Provide a concise yet accurate description of the {{ task }} and show its application ( also include key variables.);",
    "modification_direction":["some possible directions to improve the {{ task }}, feel free to explore!",],
}

Tips:
1) You must traverse all possible position of <key code> if you want to modify the {{ task }}
2) You need to give us some advice to modify the {{ task }}. e.g. some potential directions to change the heuristics. (The directions should be feasible)
3) Notice that, you can only change {{ task }}.
{{ other_tips }}

<key code> of SAT solver is:
"""
{{ origin_key_code }}
"""

Take a deep breath and think it step by step. Then respond strictly in JSON format!

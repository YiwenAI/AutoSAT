This is important to ensure that the solver has explored a significant portion of the search space before restarting.\n  * The second condition `fast_lbd_sum / conflicts > 10` ensures that the average LBD (Literal Block Distance) of the learnt clauses is high. This indicates that the solver is learning large and relevant clauses, which is a good sign for the solver's progress.\n  * The third condition `lbd_queue_size > 50` ensures that the solver has a significant number of learnt clauses in its LBD queue. This indicates that the solver has explored a diverse set of clauses and is likely to be closer to finding a solution.\n\nBy combining these conditions, the restart function can help the solver escape from local optima by resetting the search and exploring new parts of the search space", "8": "else if (conflicts >= 10000 && fast_lbd_sum / conflicts > 10) restart();", "9": " the provided experiment results, the best judgement condition of the restart function seems to be:\n```bash\nelse if (conflicts >= 10000 && fast_lbd_sum / conflicts > 10) restart();\n```\n\nThis condition resulted in an execution time of 851 seconds, which is better than the original code's execution time of 895 seconds", "10": " the experiment results, the judgement condition of restart function that provides the best execution time is:\n```\nelse if (conflicts >= 1000 && fast_lbd_sum / conflicts > 10) restart();\n```\n\nThis condition has an execution time of 851 seconds, which is better than the original code's execution time of 895 seconds", "11": "else if (conflicts > 1000 && fast_lbd_sum / lbd_queue_size > 10) restart();", "12": "else if (conflicts > 1000 && fast_lbd_sum / lbd_queue_size > 10) restart();", "13": "else if (conflicts > 1000 && fast_lbd_sum / lbd_queue_size > 10) restart();", "14": " the experiment results, the best judgement condition of restart function is: \n```else if (conflicts > 1000 && fast_lbd_sum / lbd_queue_size > 10) restart();\n``` \nThis condition has the shortest execution time of 850 seconds, which is better than the original code's execution time of 895 seconds", "15": " the experiment results, the best judgement condition of restart function is: \n```c\nelse if (conflicts > 1000 && fast_lbd_sum / lbd_queue_size > 10) restart();\n```\n\nThis condition has the shortest execution time of 850 seconds, which is faster than the original code's execution time of 895 seconds", "16": "else if (conflicts >= 10000 && fast_lbd_sum / conflicts > 10) restart();", "17": "else if (conflicts >= 10000 && fast_lbd_sum / conflicts > 10) restart();", "18": "else if (conflicts > 1000 && fast_lbd_sum / conflicts < 5) restart();", "19": " the provided experiment results, the judgement condition of restart function that performed the best was:\n```c\nelse if (conflicts >= 10000 && fast_lbd_sum / conflicts > 10) restart();\n```\n\nThis condition resulted in an execution time of 858 seconds, which is faster than the original code's execution time of 895 seconds. Therefore, this judgement condition could be used to improve the performance of the SAT solver", "20": "else if (conflicts >= 10000 && fast_lbd_sum / conflicts > 10) restart();", "21": "else if (conflicts >= 10000 && fast_lbd_sum / conflicts > 10) restart();", "22": " the experiment results, the judgement condition of restart function provided in the last iteration:\n```bash\nelse if (conflicts >= 10000 && fast_lbd_sum / conflicts > 10) restart();\n```\n\nhad the best execution time of 858 seconds, which is better than the original code's execution time of 895 seconds. Therefore, I suggest keeping this judgement condition as it is.\nHowever, if you still want to explore other judgement conditions, you could try experimenting with different values for the conflicts threshold and the ratio of fast_lbd_sum to conflicts. For example, you could try decreasing the conflicts threshold to 5000 or increasing the ratio to 15. You could also try using different variables or combinations of variables as inputs to the judgement condition.\nHere is an example of another judgement condition that you could try:\n```bash\nelse if (conflicts >= 5000 && fast_lbd_sum / conflicts > 15 && slow_lbd_sum / conflicts < 5) restart();\n```\n\nThis judgement condition restarts the solver if the number of conflicts is greater than or equal to 5000, the ratio of fast_lbd_sum to conflicts is greater than 15, and the ratio of slow_lbd_sum to conflicts is less than 5. You could experiment with different values for these thresholds and ratios to see if you can find a judgement condition that improves the execution time even further", "23": "else if (conflicts >= 10000 && fast_lbd_sum / conflicts > 10) restart();", "24": "else if (conflicts >= 10000 && fast_lbd_sum / conflicts > 10) restart();", "25": " the experiment results, the judgement condition of restart function that provides the best execution time is: \n```c\nelse if (conflicts >= 10000 && fast_lbd_sum / conflicts > 10) restart();\n```\n\nThis condition has been consistently providing execution time around 849 seconds, which is better than the original code's execution time of 895 seconds.
